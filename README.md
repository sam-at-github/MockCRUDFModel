# TestModels
This repository contains a mock up of a PHP model wrapper used for testing ...  A "model" here is effectively a wrapper over collection of related objects, that is id indexed, supprt CRUDF by implementing create, read, update, delete, find methods, and generally presumed peristent (like a Mongo collection or relation DB table). This mock up is not peristent.
